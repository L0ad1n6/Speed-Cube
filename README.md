# Speed-Cube
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

This is my vision of an ultimate speed cube because it will have features from a range of cube. (Core/Edge-Corner Magnets, Custom Size, Adjustable Weight) These will all be optional and everything will be free. At this stage of design I would not recommend printing the stl files. I will be updating this page as quickly as possible.

## Disclaimer
This project is not complete, hopefully one day it will have come to a point where you can choose any features and print a cube with those. Progress is stagnant as there is alot to do and I am working on other projects.
